			Congratulations! This is an exciting new step! I encourage you to bring at least 2 outfits 
			and plan out details that express both of you. I offer my land for use or we could hit up a 
			neighboring town, forestry, or possibly your family farm? I'm laid back and my goal is for you 
			both to be at ease with me so I'm able to capture the love between you <3
