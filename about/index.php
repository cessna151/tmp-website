		"My Senior daughter and b/f wanted some couple shots added in to their senior photos and 
		Taylor made Photography exceeded... my expectations. She was able to take amazing and classy 
		pictures that they can have and share forever. They loved working with her and she was able 
		to get pictures that show their personality and love that look as natural as if you walked by 
		them in the park."
