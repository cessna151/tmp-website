			I enjoy meeting families and watching their personalities shine when interacting with loved 
			ones. I am laid back and encourage my families (even the adults) to express their 
			personalities. I want you to be at ease while working with me.  I offer my land (beautiful 17 acres) 
			with neighboring fields for use. I also have an in home studio (best suited for lil ones and Newborns). 
			I am located near a small town and will travel up to 20 miles from studio with prior arrangements.
			I understand that some children need to warm up before they can be their self, that's ok! Just let me 
			know you need to stop by a bit earlier, let them hang and get used to the surroundings and myself.
