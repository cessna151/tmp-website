			I enjoy meeting families and watching their personalities shine when interacting with loved 
			ones. I'm laid back and encourage my families (even the adults) to express their 
			personalities. I want you to be at ease while working with me.  I offer my land (beautiful 17 acres) 
			with neighboring fields for use. I also have a full service studio.  
			I'm located near a small town and will travel up to 20 miles from studio with prior arrangements.
			I understand that some children need to warm up before they can be their self, that's ok! Just let me 
			know you need to stop by a bit earlier, let them hang out and get used to the surroundings and myself.
