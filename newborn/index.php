			Are you about to welcome a new baby? Congrats! Newborn pictures are important, you will 
			cherish these moments as time quickly passes by. What to expect: I will have my studio very 
			warm, I ask that you and whoever may be attending to dress accordingly, bring extra clothes. 
			Please, be comfortable and make sure you eat before you come. I ask that baby is kept awake 
			and fed at least an 1 hour before you leave and be ready to feed baby a lil snack once you 
			arrive (we want a happy full baby). I ask that you bring a nook pacifier (as this kind 
			does not leave red marks) even if baby doesn't take one (trust me, this can make or break 
			it for us). Sometimes they just need it to sooth their self back to sleep. Please feel free to 
			contact me if you have questions.
