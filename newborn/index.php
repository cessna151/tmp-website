			Are you about to welcome a new baby? Congrats! Newborn pictures are important, you will 
			cherish these moments as time quickly passes by. We need to get baby in between day 5-14. 
			Studio will be warm, I ask that you and whoever may be attending to dress accordingly, bring extra clothes, 
		        be comfortable and make sure you eat before you come. I ask that baby is kept awake 
			and fed  1 hour before you leave and be ready to feed baby a  snack once you 
			arrive (we want a happy, sleepy and  full baby). Please feel free to 
			contact me if you have questions.
